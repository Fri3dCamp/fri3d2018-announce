<p>At our first event in 2014, we discovered that the majority of attendees (and their children) were Flemish. A lot of the camp content and communication was therefore in Dutch.</p>
<p>We want to make Fri3d Camp a unique experience for families with (young) children, and therefore have decided to focus on Dutch as our main language. If we would use English as our main language, a lot of children would find it hard to participate in a meaningful way.</p>
<p>So, instead of pretending to be an English speaking event, we took the pragmatic route and changed our main communication to Dutch for the 2016 edition, which worked out well so we will continue this in 2018.</p>
<p>Non-Flemish speakers are of course very <strong>welcome</strong>&nbsp;to join camp. Most attendees will be fluent in English, and individual communication will rarely pose a problem.</p>
<p>We'd also like to refer you to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/english">English-language information page</a> on the website.</p>
