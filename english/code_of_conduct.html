<h2>What happens when the code of conduct is not followed?</h2>
        <p>The orga-team is strict for behaviour and mild for people. Excluding someone from the camp is only the last resort. The orga-team will always first try to sensitize, defuse situations, remind people of the code of conduct, etc. to change behaviour.&nbsp;There is a <strong>neutral mediator</strong>&nbsp;invited, to help solve conflicts and frictions and to improve cohesion on camp.</p>
        <p>However, at repeated or very serious offenses that are troublesome for other participants, it can happen that someone is removed from the campsite and denied access, without reimbursement for tickets or other expenses.</p>
