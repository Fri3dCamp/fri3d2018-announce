        <p>The <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/G65KsU6fp8E2">railway station of Sint-Joris-Weert</a> is one and a half kilometers away from the campsite, for those with limited luggage this is an ideal way to get to Fri3d Camp.</p>
        <p>The campsite is easily accessible by car and we foresee <strong>enough parkingspace</strong>. But the road leading to the campsite is rather narrow and we would like to avoid needless commotion. For that reason we ask wherever possible to share a car, during Fri3d Camp we will make sure there is no unneeded car traffic on the campsite, not only to keep the great experience but also to ensure safety.</p>
