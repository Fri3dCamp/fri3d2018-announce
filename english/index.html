<h2>About Fri3d Camp</h2>
<p>A bi-annual family friendly summer get-together for hackers, makers and DIYers. 2018 will be our third edition, for which we plan to gather 512 people with a broad spectrum of interests.</p>
<p>At Fri3d Camp we live by the hacker ethos: <strong>Be excellent to eachother</strong>. This means that every participant makes sure that Fri3d Camp becomes an unforgettable experience for everyone. Fri3d Camp provides the <strong>perfect environment for mutual learning</strong>, where young and old engage in activities together.</p>
<p>The inspiration for Fri3d Camp are larger European hacker camps such as  <a href="https://events.ccc.de/camp/">CCC Camp</a> (Germany) or <a href="https://sha2017.org/">SHA</a> (Netherlands).</p>

<h2>Theme</h2>
<p>Although the Fri3d Camp 2018 programme will cover a broad range of topics, we’ve decided to place the spotlight on <strong>one central theme: 'robots'</strong>. Robots will get special treatment throughout the camp.</p>

    <h2>Language</h2>
    <p>Since Fri3d Camp takes place in the northern part of Belgium, the primary language is Dutch. Most of the camp attendees do speak English (and probably French and German too), so if Dutch is not your mother tongue - you are still extremely welcome at Fri3d Camp.
