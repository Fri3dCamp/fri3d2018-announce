    <h2>What should I bring?</h2>
<blockquote>A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.&nbsp;&emdash;Douglas Adams</blockquote>
<h3>Special requests</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blinkenlights</strong>. At a hackercamp it is custom to decorate your tent with many a lights. Time and time again there are people regretting not having brought out the old christmas garland from the basement. It's a small effort to bring them along, decorate your tent and join the nightly spectacle of thousands of tiny lights!</li></ul>
<h3>The usual suspects</h4>
<ul>
<li>You don't need your <strong>ticket</strong>, we know who you are.</li>
<li><strong>Cash</strong>. If you want vouchers for drinks and snacks, if you want to buy a bread, bring cash. If you like the workshop you just did, there will be extra kits for sale by the workshop organisers (soldering kits, lockpicking tools, 3d pens, forging silver rings,....).</li>
<li><strong>Clothing</strong>. Make sure you bring your stack of geeky shirts and your most sexy pajamas, even sandals with socks are welcome. Take a look at the weather forecast (heatwave? or flood?) to match your clothes. An extra sweater for the evenings or in the tent is always a good plan.</li>
<li><strong>Toilet bag</strong>&nbsp;With a toothbrush, deodorant and your favorite showergel. There are ample showers on the campsite.</li>
<li><strong>Toilet paper</strong>&nbsp;because even if we do bring a decent supply, your own private roll always comes in handy for about anything.</li>
<li><strong>Sunscreen</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>medicines</strong>, for example things against mosquito, diarrhea or hangovers.</li>
<li><strong>Towel</strong>. Really, how could you survive a hacker camp without one?</li></ul>
<h4 class="c18" id="h.jzo7w6jlidvi"><strong>Sleeping</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tent</strong>. Everyone can set up his or her tent on our terrains. Check up front if it's still complete. If you do not have a tent you could check at Decathlon. (they provide decent tents starting between 30 and 50&euro;). Are you coming with a caravan or camper? Pass on this information up front.</li>
<li><strong>Sleeping bag</strong>&nbsp;or a blanket if you prefer. Don't forget a <strong>pillow</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Air mattress</strong>&nbsp;or a cot. Remember that pump!</li>
<li><strong>Flashlight</strong>. Headlights are very handy, but so is a lamp you can hang in your tent. During the evening we will hand out lightsticks to all the kids, that way they will at least be well visible by night.</li>
<li>Would you like to make it a bit more cozy near your tent, bring a <strong>camping chair</strong>&nbsp;or a small table.</li>
<li>If it gets very sunny and hot, you can use an aluminium <strong>safety blanket</strong>&nbsp;to keep the heat out of your tent.</li>
<li>Put your car's <strong>fire extinguisher</strong>&nbsp;in your tent.</li>
<li>Remember to bring a <strong>garbage bag</strong>&nbsp;to hang near your tent.</li></ul>
<h4 class="c18" id="h.lmfp7pnxdd4"><strong>Computer and occupational therapy</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>computer</strong>&nbsp;and it's power supply are certainly welcome. Don't forget to make a backup before the camp and leave that at home. There is wireless internet access all over the campsite, so network cables are only needed if you would need them yourself.</li>
<li>A <strong>micro USB</strong>&nbsp;cable to hack and power your badge.</li>
<li>If you would like to start working on our Arduino-compatible badge, bring a breadboard, a box of <strong>components</strong>, pinheaders (there are 6 pins, GND and VCC), and breadboard cables. You could also make a low-tech jacket for your badge, that's also allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Distributor plugs</strong>&nbsp;and an <strong>extension cord</strong>, that way we can get the power really everywhere. You will however need to share and daisychain with your neighbour, both in the hackerspace as on the campsite! Would you like to connect your computer or Raspberry Pi to a network cable, you will have to provide that one yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Gadgets</strong>, ranging from tablets to flying 3d printers, they are all welcome.</li>
<li>There is plenty to do on the campsite, but you can always bring a <strong>project</strong>&nbsp;(just tinkering or quantumcomputers, all is possible) to work on, or just to demonstrate.</li>
<li>Kids can bring their favorite <strong>toys</strong>. That robot, trike, ball, kubb-set or boardgame are most certainly welcome.</li>
<li>And if you would really like to get to work on the camp, bring your <strong>tools and parts</strong>&nbsp;with you, we have plenty of spaces to work at with chairs and tables where we can all start creating.</li>
<li>Bring a <strong>headset</strong>&nbsp;if you would like to listen to your own music.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="c18" id="h.hxuovl1syq5r"><strong>Food and drinks</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>We arrange a hot meal for everyone on saturday and sunday night, this is included in your ticket.</li>
<li>Bring you own <strong>breakfast</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>lunch</strong>. Cereals, bread with some spread, chocolate, or fruit, snacks, crisps, a can of sausages, candy, ...., you know better than anyone what you like. Be aware that there is <strong>no refrigerator</strong>&nbsp;for these things, so all should be able to survive a weekend in the tent.</li>
<li>Everyone brings their own <strong>plate, silverware and cup</strong>. You can use those for the joint meals. We minimize the use of throw away plates and silverware. There are plenty of wash basins and we provide dishwashing soap and sponges for all.</li>
<li>You can buy drinks at the bar, so no need to haul with those. There wil be an extended selection of Mate and special sodas in stock, at democratic prices. We will provide free coffee during the whole event. Would you like <strong>liquor</strong>, bring it yourself, we will provide the accompanying soda and lime at the bar.</li>
