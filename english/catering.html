        <p>Your <strong>ticket grants you two hot meals</strong>, on saturday and sunday night, because it is pleasant to eat together. Just as last time we arrange these meals for everyone, included in the ticketprice, to make sure everybody gets provided sufficient sugars, proteins and fats.</p>
        <p>As a snack you may also pick up some <strong>free fruit</strong>&nbsp;at the bar (currently subject to change).</p>
        <p>For the <strong>other meals</strong>&nbsp;we ask you to be <strong>self-sufficient</strong>. Don't forget to pack a stack of fruit, snacks, bread, spread, etc.</p>
        <p>There is a <a href="https://www.delhaize.be/nl-be/storedetails?storeName=10048646">Delhaize Proxy supermarket</a> near De Kluis where you could drop in for groceries, even on sundaymorning.</p>
        <p>At the <strong>bar</strong> you can continuously find a chill drink (We have Mate and a variety of special sodas), a <strong>pintje</strong>&nbsp;or a stronger beer, or even a healthy and energetic <strong>snack</strong>. We also serve 24/3 free <strong>coffe</strong>, for the productive types.</p>
        <p>If you would like a <strong>strong one</strong>&nbsp;at the campfire, you need to bring you won bottle. The soda, straws and lime that should go with the whisky, rum or wodka, those are on us.</p>
